			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Welcome to Brendan's Link page.  Here, you can find all of the websites that Brendan built over the last quarter in his web design class.  You can see how Brendan's style has evolved over the last few monthes from his earliest (and ugliest) website called headings to his most recent design, which is a biography about Keanu Reeves.</p>

			<h2>The Links</h2>

				<h3>Headings</h3>
					<p><a href="https://brendancummings.github.io/q3/headings/">Headings</a> is the first website that Brendan designed, it is very ugly and should not exist</p>

				<h3>Top 10</h3>
					<p>The <a href="https://brendancummings.github.io/q3/top10/">Top 10</a> website is the next step in Brendan's websites. This website shows Brendan's most favorite things, like BACON! and other stuff.</p>

				<h3>Recipe</h3>
					<p>This website is a recipe for Brendan's favorite food: <a href="https://brendancummings.github.io/q3/recipe/">Whoopie Pies.</a> A delicious dessert made of two cookie sized cakes sandwiching a cream center.</p>
				<img src="images/reeves.jpg" alt="Keanu Reeves" class="linkpics">
				<h3>Keanu Reeves</h3>
					<p>This website was a challenge to first use sections, divs, and articles. <a href="
					https://brendancummings.github.io/q3/reeves/">Keanu Reeves</a> is an inside joke among Brendan's friends, so Brendan wrote an entire biography about him.</p>

				<h3>Super Bowl LII</h3>
					<p>This website is about the most recent <a href="
					https://brendancummings.github.io/q3/floats/superbowllii.html">Super Bowl.</a> We used this website to learn how to float pictures.</p>

				<h3>Brendan's Autobiography</h3>
					<p>This page is all about <a href="https://brendancummings.github.io/webclass/">Brendan</a> and how Brendan is so amazing, there are links at the bottom, they don't work.</p>
